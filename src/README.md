# Well-Architected II - time for a new framework?
[https://well.architected.to/](https://well.architected.to/)[^1]

Over ten years ago we wrote *Well-Architected* to help people build better
systems. It set a standard - and others followed. Fourteen plus frameworks later,
most haven't kept pace with how we really build and operate technology today.  

Is it time for **Well-Architected II**?

Those who know me know I don't trust my instincts or opinions too much -  
I'd never write a new version without data. So, a quick poll:

which areas most need to evolve?
* Platform engineering / developer experience
* AI / Data
* Business and product alignment
* Governance / ethics
* Multi-cloud / cross-platform and vendor
* Don't do this, sequels never work out well

Comment if you think something's missing - or what you dislike about today's
frameworks. I'm also keen to hear **how** you'd want to access it: book,
mobile app, or dev tooling? And whichever you choose - what's the *one thing*
you'd want from it?

Many of the current frameworks suffer from the same issues:  
- Overly complex, vendor-biased  
- Too large, not bite-sized or actionable  
- Slow to adapt to platform engineering and AI realities  
- Certification grind over actual learning  
- Brownfield refactoring ignored  
- Tooling: missing, lacks dependency and visualisation  
- Not reacting to industry learnings: Wardley Maps, Residuality Theory,
  vibe coding  

If we're going to create *Well-Architected II*, it has to be  
**data-driven, cross-vendor, lean, and effective** - the sort of  
framework that just works.

`.to` it is. Hopefully this reinforces WA2's practicality over theory.

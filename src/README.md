# Well-Architected II - time for a new framework?

Over ten years ago I helped launch[^1] 𝘞𝘦𝘭𝘭-𝘈𝘳𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘥 to 
help people build better systems. It set a standard - 
and others followed. Fourteen plus frameworks later, 
most haven't kept pace with how we really build and 
operate technology today.

So... is it time for **Well-Architected II**?

Those who know me know I don't trust my instincts or opinions too much -
I'd never write a new version without data. So, a quick poll[^2]:

**Should we create Well-Architected II?** [https://well.architected.to/](https://well.architected.to/)[^3]

* ✅ Yes - time for a new one
* 🤔 Maybe - needs discussion
* 😐 No opinion / unsure
* 🚫 Please don’t - sequels fail

Comment if you think something's missing - or what you dislike about today's
frameworks. I'm also keen to hear **how** you'd want to access it: book,
mobile app, or dev tooling? And whichever you choose - what's the *one thing*
you'd want from it?

Many of the current frameworks suffer from the same issues:
- Overly complex, vendor-biased
- Too large, not bite-sized or actionable
- Slow to adapt to platform engineering and AI realities
- Certification grind over actual learning
- Tooling: missing, lacks dependency and visualisation
- Not reacting to industry learnings: Wardley Maps, Residuality Theory,
  vibe coding
- Missing key focus areas like:
  * Platform engineering / developer experience
  * AI / Data
  * Business and product alignment
  * Governance / ethics
  * Multi-cloud / cross-platform and vendor
  * Brownfield refactoring ignored
  * Requirements / Compliance/ Specification

If we're going to create *Well-Architected II*, it has to be **data-driven, cross-vendor, lean, and effective** - the sort of framework that just works.

`.to` it is. A small reminder that WA2 should be practical over theoretical.
